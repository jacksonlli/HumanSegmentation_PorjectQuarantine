## User stories
 As a user, I want to obtain a png of each segmented individual person (instance segmentation) in an image so that I can use them in Photoshop projects.
 As a user, I want to have an option to obtain a png of segmented groups of people (semantic segmentation) so that I can directly use the group in Photoshop projects.
 As a user, I want to specify where to save the output png files so that I can find them easier.
