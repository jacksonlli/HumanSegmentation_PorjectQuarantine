##Setup-up instructions

currently only works on Windows due to the use of openpose.exe

1. Download openpose binaries from https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/releases and extract it in root (such that "root"/openpose/bin/)


## User stories
 As a user, I want to obtain a png of each segmented individual person (instance segmentation) in an image so that I can use them in Photoshop projects.
 
 As a user, I want to have an option to obtain a png of segmented groups of people (semantic segmentation) so that I can directly use the group in Photoshop projects.
 
 As a user, I want to specify where to save the output png files so that I can find them easier.
 
 As a user, I want the option to add multiple input images so that I can get more segmented people faster.
